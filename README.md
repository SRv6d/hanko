# Usage

```
Keeps your Git allowed signers file up to date with signing keys configured on software development platforms like GitHub and GitLab.

Usage: hanko [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

Commands:
  update  Update the allowed signers file
  signer  Manage allowed signers
  help    Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -c, --config <PATH>  The configuration file [env: HANKO_CONFIG=]
      --file <PATH>    The allowed signers file [env: HANKO_ALLOWED_SIGNERS=]
  -v, --verbose...     Use verbose output
  -h, --help           Print help
  -V, --version        Print version
```

## Quickstart

```sh
cargo install --locked hanko && hanko signer add octocat octocat@github.com
```

This will install `hanko` using cargo, create a configuration file containing a single allowed signer and update the allowed signers file accordingly. For other installation methods see [installation](#installation).

## Adding an allowed signer

To use `hanko`, a set of signers to track need to be configured first.
For starters, we'll add the GitHub user `octocat` with a single principal `octocat@github.com`.

```sh
$ hanko signer add --no-update octocat octocat@github.com
Updated configuration file ~/.config/hanko/config.toml
```

Since we didn't have a configuration file yet, hanko went ahead and created one for us in the default location at `~/.config/hanko/config.toml`, containing our newly added signer.

```toml
[[signers]]
name = "octocat"
principals = ["octocat@github.com"]
```

Given that we told `hanko` not to touch the allowed signers file yet using the `--no-update` argument, it is left as-is. We'll update it in the next step.

> [!TIP]
> Should you prefer to create the configuration file by hand, head to [Configuration](#configuration).

## Updating the allowed signers file

Now that we've configured at least one signer, it's time to update the Git allowed signers file with their signing keys.

```sh
$ hanko update
Updated allowed signers file ~/.config/git/allowed_signers in 105.315473ms.
```

If an allowed signers file is configured in Git, `hanko` will write to that file.
Should no allowed signers file be configured within Git, or should you want to specify a different path, the `--file` runtime option may be used.

Our allowed signers file now contains all signing keys configured by `octocat` under the principal `octocat@github.com`.

```
octocat@github.com ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIN3ZSWa2S+RI/GdKi6WXl4k+FZ8ecAo0H2dtfLRWuhIs
octocat@github.com ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAILSK47p5e3KlWAqe1yPkPZUSK3TJVJUzLqKdaPq/ClOa
```

Any commits made by octocat with the email `octocat@github.com` and signed by one of their signing keys will no be considered as valid by Git.

# Installation

## Using Cargo

```sh
cargo install --locked hanko
```

Or using [cargo binstall](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall) should you prefer not to build yourself.

```sh
cargo binstall hanko
```

## Using Homebrew

```
brew install srv6d/tap/hanko
```

## Using Docker

From scratch docker images are [built](https://github.com/SRv6d/hanko/blob/main/Dockerfile) and attested in CI for every release and are available through the GitHub container registry for this repository.

```sh
docker run -it ghcr.io/srv6d/hanko
```

## Using pre-built binaries

Binaries for most platforms are built and attested in CI and are available for every [release](https://github.com/SRv6d/hanko/releases).

### Verifying Binaries and Release Assets

All release assets are built in CI and utilize Build Provenance Attestation, providing a way to cryptographically verify the build instructions, environment and git revision used in the process.

You can verify a release asset using the [`gh` CLI](https://cli.github.com).

```sh
$ gh at verify -R srv6d/hanko hanko-v0.5.1-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz
Loaded digest sha256:32b37a255ce6ff7a961ccd18d3e1e1207814a2f4410042919a48552ddaf254f9 for file://hanko-v0.5.1-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz
Loaded 1 attestation from GitHub API
âœ“ Verification succeeded!

sha256:32b37a255ce6ff7a961ccd18d3e1e1207814a2f4410042919a48552ddaf254f9 was attested by:
REPO         PREDICATE_TYPE                  WORKFLOW
SRv6d/hanko  https://slsa.dev/provenance/v1  .github/workflows/build.yml@refs/tags/v0.5.1
```

Alternatively, using the sigstore [`cosign` CLI](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign), after downloading the appropriate [attestation](https://github.com/srv6d/hanko/attestations).

```sh
$ cosign verify-blob-attestation --bundle SRv6d-hanko-attestation-3372432.sigstore.json \
      --new-bundle-format \
      --certificate-oidc-issuer="https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com" \
      --certificate-identity-regexp="^https://github.com/SRv6d/hanko/.github/workflows/build.yml@refs/tags/v.*$" \
      hanko-v0.5.1-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz
Verified OK
```

# Configuration

## Example

```toml
signers = [
    { name = "torvalds", principals = ["torvalds@linux-foundation.org"], sources = ["github"] },
    { name = "gvanrossum", principals = ["guido@python.org"], sources = ["github", "gitlab"] },
    { name = "graydon", principals = ["graydon@pobox.com"], sources = ["github"] },
    { name = "cwoods", principals = ["cwoods@acme.corp"], sources = ["acme-corp"] },
    { name = "rdavis", principals = ["rdavis@acme.corp"], sources = ["acme-corp"] },
    { name = "pbrock", principals = ["pbrock@acme.corp"], sources = ["acme-corp"] }
]

[[sources]]
name = "acme-corp"
provider = "gitlab"
url = "https://git.acme.corp"
```

## Optional Features

The following cargo features can be used to enable additional functionality.

- **detect-allowed-signers** _(enabled by default)_: Enables use of the [gix-config] crate to detect the location of the allowed signers file from Git configuration.
